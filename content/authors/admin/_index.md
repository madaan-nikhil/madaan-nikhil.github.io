Hi, This is Nikhil Madaan. I’m a Senior AI Research Engineer at Bloomberg AI, focusing on multi-variate time-series modeling to build real-time pricing models.

Previously, I was a M.S. in Computer Engineering (AI-ML Concentration) student at Carnegie Mellon University. During my time at CMU, I was a part of MultiComp Lab, where I worked with Jianing “Jed” Yang and Prof. Louis-Philippe Morency on bias analysis in Multimodal QA datasets. I was also a part of Lion’s Research group, where I worked on Personalized Federated Learning with Dr. Taejin Kim and Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong.

During my master’s, I interned at Amazon as Applied Scientist, with the Media and ADs group, where I worked with Dr. Manisha Verma on multi-modal product headline generation. Prior to my master’s I worked as SWE-ML at Flipkart as a part of the Catalog Ingestion team, where I played a significant role in designing and implementing scalable AI systems.

I am particularly interested in the applications of Deep Learning in areas such as Natural Language Processing, 3d-Computer Vision, and Multimodal ML.
